summary_description: |
  <p>Today, the ore mill still stands, and the stamps and mercury float tables can be viewed. Other buildings still standing include homes, blacksmith shop, stage coach shop and stable, machine shop, and assay office. Some buildings are open to enter, while others offer interior views of their contents through the windows. There are also headworks on some of the mine shafts. The structures are now part of Berlin-Ichthyosaur State Park. Ichthyosaur fossils were found in the area in 1928. Ichthyosaurs were large prehistoric marine reptiles. Some of the fossils were left where they were found and can be viewed onsite.

history: |
  <p>The town of Berlin sprang up in 1896 when substantial gold veins were discovered nearby. In total, the Berlin Mine produced 42,000 troy ounces (46,080 oz; 1,306.346 kg) of gold, all removed from tunnels by hard rock mining techniques. The mine became unprofitable by 1911, and the town of Berlin became uninhabited shortly thereafter.
