summary_description: |
  <p>The state of Montana maintains the mine superintendent's house and the ruins of the union hall as Granite Ghost Town State Park. There are various other remains of buildings scattered around the mountainside including the bank and home of Mrs. \"Ma\" Waring, the last resident. The remnants of the hospital and other shacks are on private property, but the crumbling ruins of a 100-stamp mill is not to be missed.

narrative_description: |
  <p>Granite was built on the steep mountainsides outside of Philipsburg. When you arrive, it's hard to grasp the layout of the town because the remains are scattered around the mountain and nature has had over 120 years to reclaim the town. Silver was first discovered in Granite in 1865. At its peak, Granite had a population of 3,000 miners who mined $20 million of silver and gold from 1885 to 1892. The mine shut down almost overnight during the silver panic of 1893. The town was deserted for three years and only regained a small percentage of its original population.
  </p>
  <p>When you arrive, take the left road and you'll see the remains of the Miner's Union Hall. The walls of the building and ceiling beams are unstable and crumbling. You can continue to a small parking area. Down a small trail is the home of Mrs. "Ma" Waring, the last resident of Granite. If you walk back past the Miner's Union Hall you see the "Visitor's Center" and can continue on to the GGW Trail. The “Visitor's Center” says to allow 2 hours for the walk. We only walked the first part of it. The trail winds through the forest and parallels a road that gets pretty rough, 4WD vehicles only.
  </p>
  <p>The trail leads to a nice sense of discovery. Most of the houses are now just the outlines of foundations. Continue on the trail (or road) and you'll “discover” the only masonry residence in Granite, the mine superintendent's house. Continue further and you'll see the remains of a 100-stamp mill. The size of the ruins is truly impressive.

history: |
  <p>Granite thrived as a silver mining town in the 1890s with a population of more than 3,000 inhabitants. For the time period, there were many modern amenities, such as the large Miners Union Hall, a library, 18 saloons, brothels, a hospital and school as well as churches. The Sherman Silver Purchase Act was repealed in 1893, drastically lowering the price of silver, and many residents left Granite, leaving only 140 residents a year later. Granite is currently entirely uninhabited.
